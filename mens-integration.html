              <h3>What is wrong with being a ‘nice guy’?</h3>
              <p>Do any of the following stand out to you?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Nice guys are dishonest - they hide their mistakes, avoid conflict, say what they think people want to hear and repress their feelings</li>
                <li>Nice guys are secretive - their approval-seeking leads to hiding things that might upset anyone - “if at first, you don’t succeed, hide the evidence”</li>
                <li>Nice guys compartmentalise - they are able to justify contradictory information about themselves by separating them into individual compartments in their minds and changing definitions</li>
                <li>Nice guys are manipulative - because they have a hard time asking for what they want in clear and direct ways, they resort to manipulation to get their needs met</li>
                <li>Nice guys are controlling - there is a constant need to control people and things around them to keep their world ‘smooth’ </li>
                <li>Nice guys give to get - their ‘generous’ giving often has unconscious and unspoken strings attached because they want to be appreciated and want reciprocation. They feel frustrated and resentful about giving so much while receiving so little in return</li>
                <li>Nice guys are passive-aggressive - they express their frustration and resentment in indirect ways such as being late, unavailable, forgetting, not following through, and repeating annoying behaviours despite promising to stop </li>
                <li>Nice guys are full of rage - although they deny ever getting angry, a lifetime of repressed frustration and resentment creates rage that erupts at unexpected and inappropriate times</li>
                <li>Nice guys are often addicted - because they bottle up so much, addictions are used to relieve stress, alter moods and/or alleviate pain.</li>
                <li>Nice guys have difficulty setting boundaries - have a hard time saying “no”, “stop” or “I’m not going to” and then feel like victims with others as the cause of their problems</li>
                <li>Nice guys are frequently isolated - despite their desire to be liked and loved, their behaviours make it difficult for others to get close to them. </li>
                <li>Nice guys are often attracted to people and situations that need fixing - this is a result of childhood conditioning, their need to look good and the quest for approval </li>
                <li>Nice guys have problems in intimate relationships - they struggle with listening, honesty, availability and constructive conflict despite the emphasis on intimate relationships</li>
                <li>Nice guys have issues with sexuality - they will deny it but are usually dissatisfied, have a disfunction, or have acted out through affairs, prostitution, compulsive masturbation etc </li>
                <li>Nice guys are usually only relatively successful - despite intelligence and talent, they usually don’t achieve their full potential. </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="mt-5 mb-5">
              <h3>What’s the alternative? Being an integrated man.</h3>
              <p>These ‘Nice Guy’ Characteristics are based on a script formed in childhood that now guides their lives. Remember to bring self-compassion as you go through this process. It’s not your fault, but it is your responsibility. A lot of these characteristics have developed as important protective mechanisms. Which of the following do you most resonate with?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Nice guys are givers - they believe their generosity is a sign of how ‘good’ they are and that this will make other people love and appreciate them</li>
                <li>Nice guys fix and caretake - usually without being asked</li>
                <li>Nice guys seek approval and validation from others - everything that they say or do is calculated to gain approval or avoid disapproval, especially in relationships with women</li>
                <li>Nice guys avoid conflict - they try to keep the world smooth by avoiding rocking the boat or upsetting anyone</li>
                <li>Nice guys hide their perceived flaws and mistakes - they fear others’ anger, shame or rejection if a mistake or shortcoming is exposed</li>
                <li>Nice guys seek the ‘right’ way to do things - they believe that there is a ‘key’ to living life that ensures that nothing can go wrong </li>
                <li>Nice guys repress their feelings - they tend to analyse rather than feel, seeing feelings as a waste of time and energy </li>
                <li>Nice guys often try to be different from their fathers - especially if they had unavailable, absent, passive, angry, philandering or alcoholic/addicted fathers </li>
                <li>Nice guys often feel more comfortable relating to women than to men - they usually have few male friends and frequently seek the approval of women, believing they are different from those other selfish, angry or abusive men</li>
                <li>Nice guys have difficulty making their needs a priority - they feel it is selfish to put their own needs first and put other’s needs at the centre, especially their partners</li>

                  <p>&ldquo;I undertook the No More Mr Nice Guy Hero's Journey program in 2021 led by Fort&eacute;. It was challenging, at times confronting and overall well worth the effort. The structured and guided week by week process was incredibly accessible and supportive. </p>
                  <p>Sharing a virtual space with other men seeking a better understanding of their level of integrity and purpose was very powerful and nurturing. The most enduring aha moment was when I realised it does not need to be perfect, I don't need to be perfect!!. At that point the stress reduced and the work flowed much better. </p>
                  <p>Am I a fully integrated man as a result? I am not sure I am there yet but I certainly know a whole lot more about myself, how I relate with others and what it feels like to be integrated. I will continue to follow that path and revisit the Journey in times of need to support my growth towards my integration and integrity. </p>
                  <p>Fort&eacute; led the process well with compassion and empathy. He also kept us all accountable in our work and the support of others. It was life-changing and I can certainly recommend it to other men who are feeling lost in the nice guy pattern of behaviour&rdquo;</p>

                  <p>&ldquo;I journeyed this with men last year with Fort&eacute; facilitating.
                    IT HAS CHANGED MY LIFE!!!!
                    I knew I wasn't happy (again) and realised that this was a pattern in my life, I didn't know what to do about it.....until Fort&eacute; handed me a book.
                    I couldn't believe how well I identified with what was written, it was scary, uncomfortable and confronting.
                    Being able to do this with other men in a safe and guided way made the journey so much clearer, connected and understandable.
                    If you resonate with some or any of the traits, this is for you!
                    Step up, be in control of your own happiness!
                    Much love.&rdquo;</p>
